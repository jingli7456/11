The text mining analysis of this study was completed on a computer with the macOS Ventura (Version 13.0) operating system. The analysis was performed using R language (Version 4.4.1) within the RStudio (Version 2025.9.2.418) integrated development environment. The main dependent R packages include tm (Version 0.7-16) for text preprocessing and corpus management, textstem (Version 0.1-4) for lemmatization, topicmodels (Version 0.2-17) for LDA topic modeling, ldatuning (Version 1.0.2) for determining the optimal number of topics, ggplot2 (Version 4.0.0), ggraph (Version 2.2.2), and igraph (Version 2.2.1) for data visualization, wordcloud2 (Version 0.2.1) for generating word clouds, RColorBrewer (Version 1.1-3) for color configuration, slam (Version 0.1-55) for sparse matrix processing, and parallel (built-in package) for parallel computing to accelerate the analysis process. Meanwhile, to ensure the reproducibility of results, the random seed was set using set.seed(1234) in all algorithms involving random processes.
